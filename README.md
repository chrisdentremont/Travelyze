# Introduction
Travelyze is an Android application created as a capstone project for Wentworth Institute of Technology by Chris D'Entremont and Gabriel Madeira.
Our goal for this capstone project was to create an application that provided two main features: the ability to look up a country by name and
view information about it, and a friend system that would let the user add other users as friends and share favorite countries. 

# Method
Android Studio was used with the Jetpack Compose framework in order to create appealing and user-friendly interfaces for our application.
We implemented a 3-tab system for the application as we felt that this was the most efficient method to display everything in the application.
The 3-tab system included a tab for the friends page where requests could be sent and received, another tab for searching through the country
database (the main page), and a third tab for viewing the user profile and performing various account functions.

# Results
We are very pleased with how the application came out in the end. We do wish that we had a bit more time to work out small kinks in the code,
but we feel that in the time that we were given to complete the capstone project, we were able to create a functioning and presentable
application.
